/**
   * This implementation exploits various properties of the internet checksum
   * described in RFC 1071.
   * It assumes a little endian machine with no support for misaligned loads.
   *
   * We do as much as possible using 16bit loads. Fetching a 16bit value
   * will swap the bytes since data is stored in network order. Therefore the
   * the resulting sum will be swapped (Byte Order Independence).
   * We also use Byte Order Independence to aligned terms of the sum.
   * The sum:
   * [A, B] +' [C, D] +' ... +' [Y, Z] [1]
   * is equal the following sum with the bytes reversed
   * [0, A] +' [B, C] +' ... +' [Z, 0] [2]
   * If the terms in sum [1] are not 16bit aligned then the terms in sum [2]
   * will be, with the exception of the first and last bytes which can be dealt
   * with seperately. By testing for 16bit alignment and choosing to group
   * terms appropriately we can use 16bit loads for the majority of the data.
   * Finally the sum uses 32bit accumulator which is folded back into 16 bits
   * This saves us having to check for carry on each iteration of the loop.
   *
   * It might be possible to improve performance using parallel summation
   * (i.e. using 32bit addition), although this would need investigation.
