\section{Introduction}

This document presents performance measurements for the XK-XMP-64 device. For
each measurement, it describes the method taken and the results obtained.
\sect{topology} starts by introducing the hypercube interconnection topology,
\sect{sync} describes a technique for global clock synchronisation and gives
timings for barrier synchronisation, and finally \sect{traffic} describes
performance and behaviour with synthetic traffic patterns.
